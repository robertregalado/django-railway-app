#### How to Use Gitbub + VSCode: Create a Repository & Merge Changes With A Pull Request

**To add, edit or delete code:
    <li>1. Create a new branch</li>
    <li>2. Create a matching pull request.</li>
    <li>1. Merge the pull request into the main branch.</li>
    <li>1. It's a bad practice to push changes directly to the main branch!</li>

**Note:**
    "backend" is a local branch. It does not exist yet in your Github repository.
