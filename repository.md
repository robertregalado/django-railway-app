### How to Use Gitbub + VSCode:
####  Create a Repository & Merge Changes With A Pull Request

**To add, edit or delete code:
    <li>1. Create a new branch</li>
    <li>2. Create a matching pull request.</li>
    <li>1. Merge the pull request into the main branch.</li>
    <li>1. It's a bad practice to push changes directly to the main branch!</li>

**Note:**
    "backend" is a local branch. It does not exist yet in your Github repository.

In case you don't see the message:
    <li>The push was unsuccessful check your internet connection (and try to push again.</li>
    <li>Or, it has been some time since you pushed a commit to your new branch.</li>
